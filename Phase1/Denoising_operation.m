function X_tilde = Denoising_operation(Y_tilde,sigma,choice)
% In this function you can add your preferred denoiser.
% We add support for BM3D and IRCNN denoisers, which were used in our TIP paper.
% To use BM3D denoiser, download it from "http://www.cs.tut.fi/foi/GCF-BM3D/BM3D.zip" and unzip it in "Denoisers_folder".
% To use IRCNN denoiser, download it from "https://github.com/cszn/IRCNN" and put it in "Denoisers_folder". However, note that MatConvNet package is required.
% If you use such an off-the-shelf denoiser, please cite also its associated paper, and not only our IDBP paper.

%%% IMPORTANT:
% Note that we wrote this function to allow IDBP treat the denoiser as a "black box"
% and not for the fastest performance (e.g. it may load the same DNN and/or transfer data between CPU and GPU in each iteration).
% For faster performance remove data transfers outside of the IDBP loop.
